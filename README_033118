1. execute run_executable.sh from bash [input file name is already specified in script, modify for other inputs]
2. generator.cpp generates data points: i have tried 2 dimension only: please test with higher dim and size [comment out graphviz codes for higher dimensions]
3. plot2d.py plots the graph for 2 dimension case only...i have used graphviz...use run_install.sh for installing it and executing code
4. min max is there in Node in kdtree.h ...stores min max across all dimensions
5. median finding is quicksearch algorithm...can be made slightly faster ..will do if needed
